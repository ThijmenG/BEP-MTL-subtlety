# BEP-MTL-subtlety

This git repository is used in the Bachelor End Project of Thijmen Goedings, "The influence of the annotation subtlety on a multi-task model, trained on the LIDC-IDRI    data set". All the content in this git is used for or generated by the LIDC-IDRI data set. In the Code directory can all the code used in this project be found. In the Figures directory can all the figures that are used in the research paper be found, aswell as the raincloud plots for all the annotations that are not used in the paper. 

To use the baseline model and the multi-task model, be sure to open all the supporting files from the Code directory. Before usage of the models is possible, download the LIDC-IDRI public available data set, run the LCR_reading_CT_to_NPY_nodules file. The nodule_meta file is generated as well as all the nodules in numpy format. After that the models can be used.
